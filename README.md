# Soccer-Analytics

# Introduction

This was my senior capstone project to complete my bachelor's degree in Data Science in 2022. Project comprises everything from initial data import from a public source on the internet, cleaning, visualisations, machine learning and statistical modeling. 

Various ideas and conclusions in the project included trying to find optimal shooting and passing positions on the field of play during a soccer match, whether shooting more often regardless of position led to more goals, and finding out what factors affected goal scoring the most. These conclusions may be able to help coaches change tactics and make personnel decisions 

# Data Background
Data was imported from Wyscout's website using publicly availible data from the 2017-18 season in Europe's top 5 leagues. 

# Methods
Uses both R and Python
